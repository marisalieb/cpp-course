# C++ course

In the main file there is the current lesson's exercise. 

And then in the codes_versions.md there are all the previous programs and exercises numbered and titled.

The notes are separated into chapters and lessons.

So far I have completed the chapters on:
- fundamental data types
- decision making
- loops
- functions

And I am currently working on:
- arrays
- pointers
- streams
- classes
