### Loops 


for loops: 
use when you know ahead of time how many times you want to execute something
for (loop/counter variable(how many times repeat); 
boolean expression or condition for when the loop should terminate; 
expression for how variable is changing after each repetition)
like (int i = 0; i < 5; i++), so i starts at 0, repeat as long as under 5, and each time increment i by 1
use {} for more than one statement in loop


range based loops: 
use when you want to iterate over a range of values
loop over list of values or array or string
see examples


while loop: 
use when you dont know yet how many times you want to repeat something
continues while condition in () is true, when its false then the loop terminates
can be combined with an if statement

do while loop:
in contrast to while loop the do while loop will be executed at least once since the while loop follows the do statement


break and continue statements:
break statement to break out of loop, often used in infinite loops
continue statement to skip an iteration


nested loops:
like print cooridnates so outer loop for values of x and inner loop loops over values for y
